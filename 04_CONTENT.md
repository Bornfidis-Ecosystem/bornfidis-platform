## Chef Bio (Brian Bornfidis)

Chef Brian Bornfidis brings two decades of international culinary experience to Vermont's farm-to-table scene. His journey began in Jamaica, continued through 13 years with Royal Caribbean cruise lines, and includes positions at the Grand Hyatt Vail and high-level embassy catering.

Recognized by the Jamaica Observer Food Awards and featured on TVJ television, Brian's cooking blends Caribbean soul with Vermont's seasonal bounty. He holds certifications in home economics, technical drawing, and marketing—bringing systematic precision to creative cuisine.

Beyond the kitchen, Brian is a social enterprise strategist and systems architect. He splits time between Vermont and Port Antonio, Jamaica, building Bornfidis into a multi-pillar regenerative ecosystem. His faith-anchored approach treats every meal as an act of stewardship and every business decision as ministry.

When he's not cooking, Brian is developing agricultural cooperatives in Jamaica, writing operating manuals for food entrepreneurs, and building the infrastructure for communities to own their own progress.
