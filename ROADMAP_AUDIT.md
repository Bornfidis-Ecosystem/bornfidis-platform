# Bornfidis Platform Readiness Audit (Founder View)

> **Conclusion:** Platform is showable. Lock core flows and founder control before heavy invites; do not scale until payments, control-from-anywhere, and error handling are set.

---

## 🟢 GREEN — Solid / Working

- Platform is live and viewable
- Admin login works
- Core pages load consistently
- People understand the vision when they see it
- Interest increases after platform tour
- Roles exist conceptually (Admin / Partner / etc.)

**👉 You can confidently show the platform.**

## 🟡 YELLOW — Must Lock Before Heavy Invites

Won’t block demos; fix before onboarding volume.

| Area | Status | Gap |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Invite flow** | Admin can send invite ✔️ | 1-click? Role-aware? Invite explains why they’re invited? |
| **Role clarity** | Farmer / Chef / Educator / Partner paths exist | You explain verbally; goal: platform explains visually |
| **Founder visibility** | — | One place: who was invited, who accepted, who hasn’t responded, who is active |
| **Mobile** | — | Jamaica = mobile-first; desktop polish later |

**👉 Platform works but still depends on you explaining.**

## 🔴 RED — Do NOT Scale Until Set

Affects trust, money, and peace of mind.

| Area | Need |
|------|------|
| **Payments** | Clear internal tracking; clear explanation of how people get paid; NCB connection clarity |
| **Founder control from anywhere** | Log in from any country; see activity without asking; pause or revoke access if needed |
| **Error handling / fallback** | If something breaks: still invite, communicate, operate manually |

**👉 Before Jamaica trip: feel unshakeable.**

## Big Insight

You don’t need coordinators yet. You need a platform that lets leaders **self-identify**.

- Miss Karine chooses how she fits
- Farmers choose how they participate
- You invite → tour → decide → proceed
- No paperwork. No chasing.
