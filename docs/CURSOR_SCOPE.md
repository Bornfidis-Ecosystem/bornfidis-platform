# Cursor Scope

One-page definition of what Cursor (technical execution) handles vs what the founder handles. Protects long-term clarity.

---

## Cursor handles

- **Code** — Implementation, refactors, and cleanup.
- **Security** — Auth guards, API protection, env usage, webhook verification.
- **Analytics** — Metrics, stats APIs, dashboards (e.g. Academy analytics, conversion rate).
- **Feature implementation** — New routes, components, and integrations as specified by the founder.
- **Architecture integrity** — Database schema, migrations, clear separation of layers (API, webhooks, lib).
- **Deploy and ops support** — Scripts, migration steps, and documentation (e.g. Operations Manual).

---

## Founder handles

- **Pricing** — What to charge; price points and bundles.
- **Positioning** — How we describe the platform and each product; who it’s for.
- **Product strategy** — Which products to launch, in what order, and what to build next.
- **Visual direction** — Imagery, product covers, founder photos, brand look and feel.
- **Strategic partnerships** — Who to work with and when to scale.

## Principle

Cursor executes. The founder decides meaning, strategy, and positioning. When in doubt: if it changes what we promise or how we price, it’s founder territory; if it’s how the system works or how it’s built, it’s Cursor territory.
